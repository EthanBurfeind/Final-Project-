			<h3>Data Analysis</h3> <p>Computer programs store a lot of information about a user in various ways. One way was the comma separated values or CVS. This allowed information to be placed in some type of spreadsheet to be analyzed. CVS also allowed for multiple data point to be inserted like the 	date, time, and which user access the imformation. </p>

	<h3>
			Big Data 
	</h3>
	<Text>
		<p> One thing that any company especially like twitter needs to think about is storage. With people constantly using and making more data companies need a good way to store and retrieve data quickly. One way was a disk array, or many hard drives connected to each other to expand storage. Hospitals also use many hard drives to store patients CT MRI scans.

	<h3>
			Machine Learning 
	</h3>
	<Text>
		<p> Machine learning has become common by large companies to make decisions for them. They end up calling this artificial intelligence, but itâ€™s not, machine learning is only good as the training data fed to it. Most data end up being biased, so most machine learning programs are biased in the end. In Law enforcement, machine learning was used to predict who would likely commit another crime. The data was revealed to be bias due to arrest history of black people being much higher than white people.

	<h2>
		My Questions for the data 
	</h2>
	<text>
		<br> 1) how is the offensive data calculated? <br>
		<br> 2) Does the league they play in affect the teams rank? <br>
		<br> 3) How is the teams defensive rating scored? <br>

	<h2>
		<br>Analyzing the Data <br>
	</h2>

	<text>
		<text> 
			<br>Here is a Link to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14rqp4os1e3PafFExMCBbhYLavYpew9vdDeVbpy39O6A/edit#gid=1078382034">Data! </a><br>
		</text> 


	<br>To answer the first quetion, the data was calculated by the amount of goals each teams scores in 90 minutes. This score is an average to rank how well each team performs on offense. This score does not include the amount of shots a team had it is only based on the average of goald each team scores.for example if the number one team scores on average of 2 goals a game playing 20 games in total then their offensive score would be 2. <br>

	<br> To answer the second question, the data shows that it does not matter what league each team plays in. The league is just to give the viewer more imformation in to each team and show who they may play in the future.<br>

	<br> To anser the third and final question, each team's deffensive stat is calculated in the exact opposite way of the offensive stats. Meaning it is how many goals a certain team lets in.To give an example lets say USA lets in 3 goals a game plaing 20 games their deffensive score would be 3. <br>
